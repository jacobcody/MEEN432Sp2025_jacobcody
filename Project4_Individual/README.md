Howdy, Nathan!

My Project 4 structure is the same in files as our group submission. Open the 4 matlab files and the simulink file. Run the 'Proj4_output.m' file to complete the process. The differences between my individual files and the group files consists of multiple instances. The first of which is the portion of the 'Proj4_track.m' file that incorporates a new structure towards the end to accound for the specified increase and decrease in height. Then, in the simulink, within the vehicle dynamics subsystem there is a new subsystem under gravity force which accounts for the new force of gravity on the car to account for in the calculation of the vehicle performance. The idea for this section of the project was using the position of the car on the track to determine what the height of the vehichle was in regards to ground level and how the vehicle performance was being altered by the loss from gravitational force. This gravity force was then implemented into the main performance function where the gravitational force was subtracted from the Net force to find acceleration. Unfortunately, this function was causing the file not to run properly, so the structure is there, but commented out so that the system still functions. From here, within the "Proj4_output.m" file the track display was altered in order to account for the newly added change in height variable.
