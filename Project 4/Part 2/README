Howdy Nathan!

Attached are our scripts Project 4 Week 2 files Proj4_track.m, 
Proj4_output, Proj4_init.m, and raceStat.m as well as our simulink Proj4_sim.slx.
These files will create the track for the EV, and make one lap around the track, although very slow.
The EV fails to complete the required 5 laps so we will be reassessing the model to ensure it completes all 5. 
There was also some trouble modeling the battery again and the soc parameters so those will also need to be addressed in the near future.
