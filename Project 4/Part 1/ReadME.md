Howdy Nathan!

Attached are our scripts Project 4 Week 1 files Proj4_track.m, Proj4_Week1_Output.m, p4_init.m, and raceStat.m as well as our simulink Proj4_sim.slx. These files are used to create an outputted track with a car making 1 lap. There are many modifications we need to make to the code and simulink in order to get this model working correctly.
