Howdy! To begin, download the Proj3_week3_init.m, Proj3_week3_main.m, Proj3_week3_runsim.m, and Proj3_week3_sim.slx files. These will be necessary to get the outputted highway and urban driving plots, as well as the energy usage for each. Also, download the hwycol.txt and uddscol.txt files as that data is the theoretical path that our vehicle is trying to model. Run the Proj3_week3_main.m file to obtain results.

The battery voltage is calculated from the open voltage, the resistance of the battery, the amount of batteries in series, and the resistance of each battery cell. These values were given and found through 2D lookup tables. This voltage is constantly changing based on the capacity of our battery as well as the characteristics of the traffic the electric vehicle is on. Regen braking was applied to lower the vehicle's output energy. The amount regenerated depends on the battery voltage. 

The results shown are the simulated velocity in blue, the drive cycle velocity in red, and a 3 mph vehicle error band. The bar graph shows the total energy output between the 2 tracks. The power output is calculated by multiplying the torque of the motor by the velocity of the car. The velocity of the car is constantly changing over time, as it's a product of the wheels and powertrain. The energy output is calculated by taking the integral of power. The final value output (the total energy) for each EPA cycle is shown on the outputted bar graph.
